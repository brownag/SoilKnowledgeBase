Acknowledgments
This document builds upon and in part is a testament to earlier geomorphologic
publications focused toward Soil Survey. Two publications deserve specific mention --
John Hawley and Roger Parsons’s Glossary of Selected Geomorphic and Geologic
Terms (1980) provided landform definitions for the western USA; and Fred Peterson’s
landmark Landforms of the Basin and Range Provinces defined for Soil Survey (1981)
devised a regional landform description guide combined with outstanding graphics. Soil
scientists used the geomorphic and geologic terminology summarized in those
documents during an important soil inventory era in the USA. These early contributions
formed a foundation and gave inspiration for this larger endeavor and the companion
document Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms (National Soil Survey Handbook –
Part 629, NRCS, current date).
We dedicate special thanks and recognition to Dr. Erling Gamble (USDA - Soil
Conservation Service, retired) who participated in the formative stage of the GDS and
Glossary. His training with Dr. James Thorpe (Earlham College) and collaborative work
with Dr. Raymond Daniels (USDA- SCS, retired), as well as his own growth in this
profession are a thoughtful and constructive part of this work. The Soil Science Division
of the USDA – Natural Resource Conservation Service supported this project.
The initial GDS release (1994) was an internal NRCS document. A condensed external
GDS publication (Version 2.06) followed (Schoeneberger and Wysocki, 1998).
Additional upgrades have been issued since then. This version (5.0) updates and
replaces all previous GDS versions.

FOREWORD
Purpose: This document provides a descriptive method and a technical guide for
applying and understanding geomorphic and geologic concepts and terms for soil
inventory used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Program in the USA.
Content: Definitions, criteria, concepts, and operational guidelines presented here
focus on soil inventory needs and applications. Our main goal is clear, consistent
definitions and concepts with succinct presentation. Space precludes expansive
treatment of all definitions or concepts included herein. Users who seek such should
consult original cited sources and additional references.
Sources: This document is a primary source for geomorphic terminology and
application for USDA-NRCS and National Cooperative Soil Survey programs. This
Geomorphic Description System is contained, in part or in total, in key NRCS
documents: National Soil Survey Handbook (NSSH), Part 629 (Soil Survey Staff, 2017);
the Field Guide for Describing and Sampling Soils, version 3.0 (Schoeneberger, et al.,
2012; limited content superceded by later NASIS updates); National Soil Information
System (NASIS), ver. 6.2 (NRCS, 2012). Information drawn from other original sources
is noted and given appropriate citation in this document. We hope this facilitates access
to original sources and encourages greater topical exploration and access to
supplementary detail.
Goal: Observe and document what exists in the field. Choice lists and terms that follow
constitute a minimal set of descriptors. Accurate, complete geomorphic field
assessment may require additional adjectives, descriptors, or sketches to capture and
convey pertinent information where established terms are lacking. Record the additional
information as needed (e.g. free-hand notes).
Changes: Soil Science and Soil Geomorphology are evolving scientific fields. Changes
in this system should and will occur. Please send comments or suggestions to the
authors at the National Soil Survey Center, USDA - NRCS, 100 Centennial Mall North -
Rm. 152, Lincoln, NE 68508-3866
Status: This version contains new terms (highlighted in bold) that have been
recently added. These changes may post-date and therefore may not be shown in
other related documents. Updates will be made to all related documents at the
earliest opportunity.

BACKGROUND
Landforms are visually recognizable earth surface features that provide humans a
sense of location. In fact, humans have informally described landforms throughout
history mainly as landmarks, obstacles to travel, or for their military value. Soil
occurrence across the earth’s surface corresponds remarkably well with landform type
and distribution. Soil scientists during the soil survey process develop landscape
models that quantify soil / landform relationships. Soil scientists can understand and
convey much about soil distribution by employing landform description. Effective
communication of such knowledge, whether among scientists, or between scientists and
the general public, requires accurate and consistent landform description.
A long-standing need exists to clarify and communicate geomorphic concepts and terms
in Soil Science, as well as, the National Cooperative Soil Survey. A broadly applicable
set of geomorphic descriptors needs to be comprehensive, consistently defined, and
follow an organized array. This Geomorphic Description System (GDS) addresses those
needs by presenting, defining, and organizing terminology. Various considerations
include, but are not limited to, time constraints, the need to blend formal and informal
terms and concepts, and competing terms and philosophies serve to complicate the
GDS design. Consequently, this system is a compromise between straightforward
practicality and strict scientific rigor.
Goals in building the GDS:
1) Foster national use of standard terms:
- Enhance the utility and scientific credibility of geomorphic information contained
in National Cooperative Soil Survey databases and products.
- Improve technical communication both within and outside NRCS.
- Encourage use of established, scientifically credible terms.
2) Maximize use of existing geomorphic information in NCSS databases and programs.
Specific Objectives:
1) Comprehensively organize geomorphic and related terminology for use in the
National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) and Soil Science.
2) Update, revise, and improve geomorphic terminology in the NCSS:
- Develop new concepts and terms where needed.
- Clarify terms to minimize erroneous use.
- Remove obsolete terms and concepts.
- Minimize redundant, competing, and conflicting terms [e.g. watercourse terms:
arroyo, coulee, drainageway, draw, gulch, gully, ravine, and wash].
3) Completeness (incorporate user-requested modifications and needs):
- Fill gaps: add or create terms in response to requests; construct "suites of
terms" that provide all pertinent options.
- Focus on previously under-represented regions and minimize regional biases.

INTRODUCTION
This system is a comprehensive presentation of geomorphic terms used in the National
Cooperative Soil Survey Program (NCSS) and in the Soil Science profession at large. It
enable’s one to effectively describe the geomorphic setting and context of a given point
or area on the Earth's surface: to convey it's form and content, and, where possible, to
indicate what processes or environments have dominated it's evolution and contributed
to it’s present state, composition, and distribution.
Categories (e.g., Landscape), are called “data elements” in the National Soils
Information System (NASIS) and defined in Appendix 1. Each category (e.g.,
Landscape) contains many choices (e.g., mountains, plains) that are tallied in lists. All
geomorphic “choice-list” terms are defined in the Glossary of Geologic and Landform
Terms - Part 629, National Soil Survey Handbook, (Soil Survey Staff, 2012), which
should be considered a companion document (and reproduced here as Appendix 2).
Many terms are drawn from geology, whereas others are modified for, or are unique to,
Soil Science. The terminology and definitions are generally in agreement with, but in
some cases more comprehensive than those in the Glossary of Soil Science Terms
(Soil Science Society America, 2017) and the Glossary of Geology (American
Geological Institute, 2005).
GDS Organization
The Geomorphic Description System (GDS) consists of three main sections:
I) Physiographic Location : Where - Specifies an existing and named geographic
area with a defined location. 1
II) Geomorphic Description : What - Identifies a discrete land surface feature
(separate entity) or assemblage of features.
How - Categorizes features by dominant origin
process or geomorphic setting.
III) Surface Morphometry : Shape - Describes land surface
shapes or geometry.
Pieces - Identifies a discrete portion of a
geomorphically defined land area or slope
segment.
[ 1 Note: Physiographic Location choice-lists may contain area names that are geomorphically or
geologically defined, but can also include culturally or geo-politically defined areas. Thus the terms
used in the Physiographic Location section (= geography) may not be consistent with Glossary
definitions. ]

PART II : GEOMORPHIC DESCRIPTION
[ A term should only be used once in a microfeature-landform-landscape
descriptive string. For example, if a term is used as a landscape term (e.g. river
valley) it should not be repeated as a landform term in the same descriptive
string. A different term that conveys additional information should be used (at
either level); e.g. flood plain (Landform) in a river valley (Landscape), rather than
a river valley (Landform) in a river valley (Landscape). ]
A) LANDSCAPES
examples: badlands
foothills
B) LANDFORMS
1. Single Landform
- occurrence on a single type of landform
examples: stream terrace, hill (singular: a pedon or point data)
examples: stream terraces, hills (plural: pedons or map unit).
2. Multiple Landforms:
a) Landform on a Landform (nested landforms):
- Commonly used for locating a pedon or a small study site.
- Listed in ascending order of scale.
examples: a blowout in a sand dune on a stream terrace.
a mudflow on a cinder cone, in a caldera.
b) Occurrence across multiple landforms
- Commonly used for locating a map unit, Official Soil Series
Descriptions, deposits, or large study sites.
example: This map unit occurs on levees, crevasse splays, and
sand bars.
C) MICROFEATURES
example: tree-tip mound
D) ANTHROSCAPES
example: suburban anthroscape
E) ANTHROPOGENIC LANDFORMS
example: borrow pit
E) ANTHROPOGENIC MICROFEATURES
example: furrow
11
PART III : SURFACE MORPHOMETRY
A) ELEVATION:
- The height of a point on the earth’s surface, relative to mean sea
level (msl); specify units.
examples: 106 m
348 ft.
B) SLOPE ASPECT:
- The compass bearing (in degrees, accounting for declination) that a
slope faces, looking downslope.
- Generalized, “quadrant” descriptions (e.g., SSW = south by
southwest) are too generic to be useful.
examples: 218
SW (too general; obsolete)
C) SLOPE GRADIENT:
- The inclination of the land surface from the horizontal. Percent
slope is the vertical distance divided by the horizontal distance,
then multiplied by 100; e.g., 18%; commonly called “slope”.
example: 17%
D) SLOPE COMPLEXITY:
- Used to simplistically describe the relative linearity (simple) or
irregularity (complex) of the ground surface leading downslope and
through the point or map unit of interest.
examples: simple
complex
E) RELATIVE SLOPE SEGMENT POSITION:
- Used to subdivide long slopes, where useful.
example: lower third
12
F) SLOPE SHAPE: (paired terms)
DOWN SLOPE & ACROSS SLOPE
(Vertical) (Horizontal)
examples: Concave - Convex
Linear - Concave
G) HILLSLOPE - PROFILE POSITION
- 2 dimensional
- Used to describe location of a point or pedon along a longitudinal
slope profile (down slope).
- Appropriate for use with point data, generally not recommended for
map units.
examples: shoulder
backslope
H) GEOMORPHIC COMPONENT:
- 3 dimensional
- Used to describe location of areas (e.g. map units, inclusions).
1) HILLS :
examples: head slope
side slope
2) TERRACES, STEPPED LANDFORMS :
examples: tread
riser
3) MOUNTAINS :
example: mountainflank
4) FLAT PLAINS :
examples: talf
rise
I) MICRORELIEF : Microrelief refers to minor, relative elevational
differences between adjacent areas or microfeatures).
example: microhigh
J) DRAINAGE PATTERN : The configuration or arrangement, in plan view,
of the stream courses in an area. It is related to the local geologic
materials, geomorphologic features and history of the area; examples
include dendritic, trellis, artificial, etc.; also called “drainage network”.
example: dendritic

Alaskan Physiographic Areas (Warhaftig, 1965)
The following Alaskan-Peninsula physiographic areas are extensions of the preceding
North American Physiographic Divisions (e.g., Rocky Mountain System). These Alaskan
extensions are presented here, rather than intermingled with the previous Division /
Province lists because they a) constitute a geographically coherent package
(Wahrhaftig, 1965); b) these extensions were not contained within Fenneman’s original
work which dealt only with the conterminous US (Fenneman, 1931; 1938; & 1946), and
c) Wahrhaftig’s map-unit numbers are independent of, and inconsistent with
Fenneman’s. Wahrhaftig’s original map unit scheme & numbers are retained here for
simplicity in using his map of the Alaskan peninsula. [ CAUTION: Wahrhaftig’s map-unit
numbers should not be confused with similar map-unit numbers from Fenneman’s map
for the conterminous US. ]

PART II: "GEOMORPHIC DESCRIPTION"
( Complete Choice-Lists, and Topical Subsets )
There are various lists of terms within this section. These lists contain only the
preferred “landform”- related terms as defined in the Glossary of Landform and Geologic
Terms, National Soil Survey Handbook - Part 629 (NRCS, 2017) to encourage the
national use of standard terms. Non-landform terms (e.g. geologic materials),
undesirable terms (e.g. redundant synonyms, obsolete terms, etc.) retained in the
Glossary for historical purposes, or legitimate landform terms not recognized in Soil
Survey have been omitted from the following lists.
The first portion of Part II presents comprehensive alphabetical lists for
Landscapes, Landforms, Microfeatures, and their anthropogenic analogues
(Anthroscapes, Anthropogenic Landfoms, and Anthropogenic Microfeatures). The
second portion of Part II groups related terms into subsets of Geomorphic Environment
or Other Groupings as an aid for locating related terms or appropriate contenders. Most
of these subsets are based upon a common process of origin (i.e. a Geomorphic
Environment). Consequently, if the origin of a landform is known or can be inferred, a
“short” list of appropriate terms can be quickly reviewed. One need not search through
a long "master" list containing numerous, unrelated terms. Note: The lists of terms are
neither mutually exclusive nor a rigid hierarchical classification system. Some features
occur in more than one Geomorphic Environment (e.g. beach occurs in both “Coastal
Marine” and "Lacustrine” geomorphic process environments), or occur at more than one
scale (e.g. river valley can occur either as a “Landscape” or a “Landform”). Generally,
terms are found in only one or two Geomorphic Environments.
Surface features (landforms, etc.) are commonly the result of multiple
geomorphic processes. In selecting or assigning a landform term to a particular
“Geomorphic Environment” list, emphasis is placed upon the dominant, near-surface
process(s) evident in the accompanying soils. For example, a kame is a landform
deposited by glaciofluvial processes and is usually modified by subsequent surficial
erosion. The dominant geomorphic processes that determine the sediments present,
their arrangement, and their intrinsic attributes relate most strongly to a Glacial
Environment, not an Erosional Grouping list.
Grouping terms by Geomorphic Environment places the emphasis on the agents,
geologic processes, and the materials responsible for the formation internal
arrangement and behavior of the landform. For example, a sand dune which occurs on
a stream terrace is of eolian origin (the dominant agent is wind); dunes are listed with
Eolian landforms. Fluvial processes may have provided the sand from which the dune
was constructed and the underlying structure upon which it rests (stream terrace - a
Fluvial-process landform), but eolian processes are responsible for the landform of
primary pedological interest.
Unfortunately, not all surface features can be adequately grouped by
Geomorphic Environment. Therefore, some additional groupings have been included.
For example, a group is included for "Depressional" features. Obviously, "Depressional"
is not a process per say. The land features in this category share a common attribute
(they are all low areas or declivities), but were not all formed by the same processes.
The features within each “Other Grouping” share a common setting or context, similar
attributes, or land use concerns rather than a common geomorphic origin.

PART II : GEOMORPHIC DESCRIPTION ( Outline )
I) COMPREHENSIVE LISTS:
A) LANDSCAPES ( broad or unique groups or clusters of spatially associated features ).
B) LANDFORMS ( discrete, natural, individual features mappable at common survey scales).
C) MICROFEATURES ( discrete, natural, individual features typically too small to delineate
at common survey scales ).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D) ANTHROSCAPES [ large areas, permanently altered (human-made / extensively
modified areas].
E) ANTHROPOGENIC LANDFORMS [ discrete, artificial (human-made or extensively
modified), earth surface features ].
F) ANTHROPOGENIC MICROFEATURES [ discrete, artificial (human-made or
extensively modified), earth surface features readily observable in
the field but too small to delineate at common survey scales].
II) GEOMORPHIC ENVIRONMENTS and OTHER GROUPINGS:
Landscape, Landform, and Microfeature terms grouped by process or common settings.
Lists are not mutually exclusive: some features occur in more than one grouping.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Coastal Marine and Estuarine ( wave, tidal, or shallow marine related).
2. Lacustrine (related to inland water bodies).
3. Fluvial [related to concentrated channel flow (e.g. stream)].
4. Solution (dominated by dissolution and subsurface drainage).
5. Eolian (wind dominated).
6. Glacial (directly related to glaciers).
7. Periglacial (related to non-glacial, cold climate).
8. Mass Movement (gravity dominated).
9. Volcanic and Hydrothermal
10. Tectonic and Structural (bedrock structures, crustal movement).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Slope (generic slope forms, geometry, or arrangement rather than process).
12. Erosional (dominated by non-channel, non-perennial water erosion).
13. Depressional (low area or declivity terms, excludes permanent water bodies)
26
14. Wetlands (related to vegetated or shallow wet areas, wet soils).
15. Water Bodies (permanent water features).
16. Subaqueous Features [submerged features generally capable of
supporting rooted plants (emergent or subaqueous), and adjacent features].
PART II : GEOMORPHIC DESCRIPTION
[ Codes: Conventionally, the entire land-feature term is used (e.g. dune field ). Some data
storage programs (e.g., NASIS) have shorthand codes. An italicized code follows each term

APPENDIX 1: DATA ELEMENT DEFINITIONS
[The following Data Elements (categories) are arranged by occurrence order in the
Geomorphic Description System (GDS), not alphabetically.]. Definitions are consistent
with the current NASIS Data Dictionary and NSSH, Part 629.]
Physiographic Location
A section within the Geomorphic Description System; it provides a hierarchical
scheme for partitioning and identifying related portions of the earth's surface
based on geography and physiography. SW
Physiographic Zone
[ Reserved for global / continental scale groupings; presently not populated . ]
Physiographic Division
A large portion of a continent of which all parts are similar in geologic structure
and climate at a small scale (e.g. 1:5,000,000) and which has consequently had
a unified geomorphic history, and whose pattern of relief or landforms differ
significantly from that of adjacent areas. Examples: the Laurentian Upland,
Atlantic Plain, Rocky Mountain System, and Interior Highlands in the U.S.A. [
The highest level in the Physiographic Location part of the Geomorphic
Description System ]. NASIS Data Dictionary
Physiographic Province
A region of which all parts are similar in geologic structure and climate and which
has consequently had a unified geomorphic history; a region whose pattern of
relief or landforms differ significantly from that of adjacent region. A subset within
a Physiographic Division; Examples: the Valley and Ridge, Blue Ridge, and
Piedmont provinces in the eastern U.S.A., and the Basin and Range, Rocky
Mountains, and the Great Plains provinces in the western U.S.A. [ The second
highest level in the Physiographic Location part of the Geomorphic Description
System ]. SW & GG NSSH, Part 629
Physiographic Section
An area which all parts are similar in geologic structure and climate at a relatively
small scale and which has consequently had a unified geomorphic history, and
whose pattern of relief or landforms differ significantly from that of adjacent areas
( = Fenneman's (1957) "Section"); i.e. a subset within a Physiographic Province.
Examples: the Mohawk, Green Mountain, and Floridian Sections in the eastern
U.S.A. and the Sacramento Section, Puget Trough, and Klamath Mountains in
the western U.S.A. [The third highest level in the Physiographic Location part of
the Geomorphic Description System]. SW & NASIS Data Dictionary
63
State Physiographic Area
An area of relatively local extent and whose parts are similar in geologic structure
and climate and which has consequently had a unified geomorphic history, and
whose pattern of relief or landforms differ significantly from that of adjacent
areas; i.e. a subset within a Physiographic Section). [ The fourth highest level in
the Physiographic Location part of the Geomorphic Description System ]. SW &
NASIS Data Dictionary
Local Physiographic / Geographic Name
The most localized description of physiographic location; commonly, local feature
names found on USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps (e.g., Robert’s
Ridge, Camas Prairie). [ The fifth highest level in the Physiographic Location
part of the Geomorphic Description System ]. SW NASIS Data Dictionary
Geomorphic Description
A section within the Geomorphic Description System; it provides a pseudo-
hierarchical scheme for identifying natural features on the earth's surface at three
relative scales (Landscape, Landform, Microfeature); human created features
(Anthropogenic Features) are handled separately. SW NSSH, Part 629
Landscape
landscape [soils] – A broad or unique land area comprised of an assemblage or
collection of natural landforms that define a general geomorphic form or setting
(e.g. mountain range, lake plain, lava plateau). Landforms within a landscape
are spatially associated but may vary in formation processes and age. SW
NSSH, Part 629
Landform
landform - Any physical, recognizable form or feature on the earth's surface,
having a characteristic shape, internal composition, and produced by natural
causes; a distinct individual produced by a set of processes. Landforms can
span a large range in size (e.g., dune encompasses a number of features
including parabolic dune, which is several tens-of-meters long, and seif dune
which can be up to 100 kilometers long. Landforms provide an empirical
description of similar portions of the earth's surface features. SW & GG
NSSH, Part 629
64
Microfeature
[soil survey] - Small, local, natural forms (features) on the land surface that are too
small to delineate on a topographic or soils map at commonly used map scales
(e.g. 1:24,000 to 1:10,000). Examples include earth pillar, patterned ground, frost
boil. Compare - microrelief. SW NSSH, Part 629
Anthroscape
(obsolete; replaced by Anthroscape, Anthropgenic Lanform, and Anthropogenic
Microfeature). An artificial feature on the land surface (including those in shallow
water), having a characteristic shape and range in composition, composed of
unconsolidated earthy, organic materials, artificial materials, or rock, that is the
direct result of human manipulation or activities; can be either constructional (e.g.
artificial levee) or destructional (e.g., quarry). SW. NSSH, Part 629
Anthropogenic Landform
a) A discrete, human-made “landform” on the earth’s surface or in shallow water,
with a characteristic shape and range in composition (unconsolidated earthy,
organic, human-transported materials, or rock) that is the direct result of human
manuipultion or activities and is mappable at common soil survey scales (e.g.,
Order 2: > 1: 10,000 and < 1:24,000). Anthropogenic landforms can be either
constructional (accumulations; e.g. artificial levee) or destructional (voids; e.g.
quarry) in origin. b) A category in NASIS and the Geomorphic Description System
for human-derived or modified “landforms”. Compare – anthropogenic
microfeature, anthroscape. SW NSSH, Part 629
Anthropogenic Microfeature
a) A small, human-made “microfeature” on the earth’s surface or in shallow water,
with a characteristic shape and range in composition of unconsolidated earthy,
organic, human-transported materials, or rock and that is typically too small to
delineate at common soil survey scales (e.g., Order 2: > 1: 10,000 and <
1:24,000). Anthropogenic microfeatures can be either constructional
accumulations (e.g. railroad bed) or destructional voids (e.g. ditch) in origin.
b) A category in NASIS and the Geomorphic Description System for human-
derived or modified “landforms”. Compare – anthropogenic landform,
anthroscape. SW NSSH, Part 629
Surface Morphometry
a) The geometry, orientation and relief of related portions of the earth's surface.
b) A section within the Geomorphic Description System which provides a scheme
for identifying and briefly describing geometry, orientation, position, and relief of
portions of the earth's surface. SW NSSH, Part 629
65
Elevation [survey]
The height of a point on the earth’s surface, relative to mean sea level (msl).
Compare – relief. SW NSSH, Part 629
Slope Aspect
The compass direction (in degrees, and accounting for declination) that a slope
faces, looking downslope; e.g., 287. Generalized prose or quadrant descriptions
(e.g., “south by southwest”) is not preferred and considered obsolete. SW
NASIS Data Dictionary
Slope Gradient
a) The inclination of the land surface from the horizontal. Percent slope is the
vertical distance divided by the horizontal distance, then multiplied by 100; e.g.,
18%. SW NSSH, Part 629
b) The difference in elevation between two points, expressed as a percentage of
the distance between those points. SSM, 1993
Slope Complexity
Used to simplistically describe the relative uniformity (smooth, linear or curvilinear
= simple) or irregularity (complex) of the ground surface leading downslope and
through the point of interest. SW NASIS Data Dictionary
Slope Shape [ also called "Land Surface Shape" in SSM (1993) ]
Slope Shape - Down Slope [ e.g., "…up and down the slope…", SSM, 2017 ]
The geometric, two dimensional profile (shape) of the slope perpendicular to
elevation contours. NASIS Data Dictionary
Slope Shape - Across Slope [ e.g.,"…shape of the contour…", SSM, 2017 ]
The geometric, two dimensional profile (shape) of the slope parallel to elevation
contours. NASIS Data Dictionary
Hillslope-Profile Position
Discrete slope segments found along a transect line that runs perpendicular to
the contour, beginning at a divide and descending to a lower, bounding stream
channel or valley floor; a discrete piece of a two-dimensional cross-profile of a
hill. Positions are commonly separated from one another by inflection points
along the line. In descending elevational order, the hillslope- profile positions of
a simple hillslope include the summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope, and
toeslope. Not all of these segments (positions) are necessarily present along a
particular slope. Complex hillslopes include multiple sequences or partial
66
sequences. Compare – geomorphic components – hills. SW, HP, & RR
NSSH, Part 629
Geomorphic Component
A fundamental, three dimensional piece or area of a geomorphic setting (i.e.,
hills, mountains, terraces, flat plains) that has unique and prevailing kinetic
energy dynamics and sediment transport conditions which result in their
characteristic form, patterns of sedimentation and soil development. SW
NSSH, Part 629
Geomorphic Component - Hills
A group of fundamental, three dimensional pieces or areas of hills. In
descending elevational order, the geomorphic components of a simple hill are the
interfluve (roughly analogous to the summit); crest (a hill top or ridge top of
converged shoulders); 3 variations of the hillslope, each distinguished by the
surface shape and the nature of overland flow: head slope (converging surface or
overland flow, especially at the head of a drainageway), side slope (parallel
surface flow), and nose slope (diverging surface flow), free face (rock outcrop);
and the base slope (colluvium / slope alluvium apron at the bottom of the hill).
SW NSSH, Part 629
Geomorphic Component – Terraces, Stepped Landforms
A group of fundamental, three dimensional pieces or areas of terraces, flood-
plain steps, and other stepped landforms (e.g. stacked lava flow units). In
descending elevational order, the geomorphic components are the tread (the
level to gently sloping, laterally extensive top of a terrace or flood-plain step, or
other stepped landforms); and the riser (the comparatively short escarpment
forming the more steeply sloping edge that descends to another level or a
channel). SW NSSH, Part 629
Geomorphic Component - Mountains
A group of fundamental, three dimensional pieces or areas of mountains. In
descending elevational order, the geomorphic components of a simple mountain
are the mountaintop (roughly analogous to the crest or summit); mountainflank
(the long slope along the sides of mountains which can be further subdivided into
three portions based on the relative slope location (upper third-, middle third-, or
lower third moutainflank); free face (rock outcrop); and the mountainbase
(colluvium / slope alluvium apron at the bottom of the mountain). SW
NSSH, Part 629
Geomorphic Component - Flat Plains
A group of fundamental, three dimensional pieces or areas of flat plains. In
descending elevational order, the geomorphic components of a simple, flat plain
(e.g. lake plain, low coastal plain, etc.) are the rise [a broad, slightly elevated
area with comparatively greater gradients (e.g., 1-3% slopes ], the talf [a
comparatively level (e.g., 0-1% slopes), laterally extensive, non-fluvial area], and
67
dip [a slight depression that is not a permanent water body nor part of an
integrated drainage network]. Compare - Geomorphic Component - Terraces.
SW NSSH, Part 629
Microrelief
a) [soil survey] Slight variations in the height of a land surface that are too small
or intricate to delineate on a topographic or soils map at commonly used scales
(e.g. 1:24,000 through 1:10,000). Choices include: microhigh, microlow.
Compare - microfeature. SW NSSH, Part 629
b) (not preferred; refer to Microfeature) Generically refers to local, slight
irregularities in form and height of a land surface that are superimposed upon a
larger landform, including such features as low mounds, swales, and shallow
pits. GG NSSH, Part 629
(obsolete) Refers to differences in ground-surface height, measured over
[lateral] distances of meters. Naturally formed features contrast with those that
are tillage determined. SSM '93, p. 76
Drainage Pattern
The configuration or arrangement, in plan view, of the stream courses in an area,
including gullies or first-order areas of channelized flow, tributaries, and main
streams. It is related to the local geologic materials, geomorphologic features
and geomorphic history of the area; major drainage pattern types include
dendritic, trellis, artificial, etc., also called drainage network. SW, GG, WA

gaps and research oppo1tunities. For example, one major area of pub­
lished research that is not addressed here deals with the vast fossil
record preserved in caves of all types and sizes (Table 2: C4). A pro­
ductive search for information on this topic should start with the com­
panion paper by Art Hanis and related publications (e.g. Harris and

(430-VI-NSSH, 2017)
629.00 Definition and Purpose.
This glossary provides the Soil Survey, soil
scientists, and natural resource specialists with
landform, geologic and related terms and
definitions to:
• Improve soil landscape description via
standard, single source landform and
geologic glossary:
• Enhance geomorphic content and clarity
of soil map unit description by accurate
use defined terms;
• Establish consistent geomorphic term
usage in Soil Science especially the
NCSS;
• Provide standard geomorphic definitions
for databases and soil survey
publications;
• Train soil scientists and related
professionals in soils as landscape and
geomorphic entities.
629.01 Responsibilities.
This glossary is the National Cooperative Soil
Survey (NCSS) standard for landform, geologic,
and related terms. The National Soil Survey
Center, Lincoln, NE is responsible for
maintaining and updating this glossary. MLRA
office soil scientists and National Cooperative
Soil Survey participants may and are encouraged
to propose additions and changes for use in
pedon or soil map unit descriptions and soil
survey publications. The Glossary of Geology
(AGI, 2005) serves as a major source for many
glossary terms. The American Geologic
Institute (AGI) granted USDA-NRCS (formerly
SCS) permission (letters dated 9/11/85 and
9/22/93) to use existing definitions.
Modifications to original AGI definitions are
explained below.

trellis. This pattern indicates marked bedrock
structural control rather than a type of bedrock and
usually indicates in which the main parallel channels
follow the strike of the beds. It is commonly

welded soil – (not preferred – use overprinted soil).
welded tuff - A glass-rich, pyroclastic rock
composed of volcanic ash indurated at the time of

TILL TERMS
Genetic classification and relationships of till terms commonly used in soil survey. (Schoeneberger, et al., 2002; adapted
from Goldthwaite and Matsch, 1988.)

( = “ice-rafted”)
1
Ablation till and basal till, generic terms that only describe “relative position” of deposition, have been widely replaced by
multiple, more specific terms that convey both relative position and process. Ablation till (any comparatively permeable,
non-sorted debris deposited within or above stagnant ice) is replaced by supraglacial melt-out till, supraglacial flow till,
etc. Basal till (any dense, non-sorted, subglacial till) is replaced by lodgement till, subglacial melt-out till, subglacial flow
till, etc.
2
Additional (proposed) till terms that have not gained wide acceptance, and are therefore considered to be Not Preferred,
and should not be used (shown for completeness).
3
Also called gravity flowtill (Not Preferred).

These size breaks are taken from geologic literature (Fisher, 1989) and based on the modified Wentworth scale. The 0.062
mm break is very close to the USDA’s 0.05 mm break between coarse silt and very fine sand (Soil Survey Staff, 1993).
The 64 mm “geologic” break is relatively close to the USDA’s 76 mm break between coarse gravel and cobbles. (See the
chart “Comparison of Particle Size Classes in Different Systems” in the “Profile / Pedon Description Section” under “Soil
Texture” in the Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger, et al., 2002).
2
A minimum size limit of 2 mm is required in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1994; p. 54), but is not required in
geologic usage (Fisher, 1989).
3
The descriptor for pumice smaller than 2 mm, as used in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). Geologic usage is
based solely upon composition and does not include any size restrictions;.
