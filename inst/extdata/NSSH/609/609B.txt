Subpart B – Exhibits
609.10 Format for Correlation Document
The following outline shows the order and character of items and data ordinarily contained in a
correlation document. It does not preclude the inclusion of other information pertinent to the survey or
the explanation of actions taken in the correlation. An example follows each item.
1. Heading
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Natural Resources Conservation Service
Classification and Correlation
of the Soil Survey of
Any Area, Any MLRA, Any State
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is an equal opportunity provider and
employer.
2. Introductory Paragraph
In this paragraph cite persons participating in the correlation, the date, the location, data
reviewed, the basis for the correlation, and other items if pertinent. For example: “John C. Smith, soil
data quality specialist, and David G. White, MLRA soil survey leader, of the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, and Joseph I. Black, associate professor, Anytown State University at Any Town,
Any State, prepared this correlation the week of October 21-25, 2000. The soil survey database, soil
survey publication, field notes, interpretations, laboratory data, correlation samples, field map sheets, and
materials from the adjacent soil surveys provide the basis for this correlation.”
3. Headnote for Detailed Soil Survey Legend
This headnote is an explanation of the symbols on the detailed soil maps in the published survey.
It appears on the SOIL LEGEND in the published report and precedes the list of map unit symbols and
map unit names. For example: “Map unit symbols consist of numbers or a combination of numbers and
letters. The initial numbers represent the kind of soil. A capital letter following these numbers indicates
the class of slope. Map unit symbols without a slope letter indicate nearly level soils or miscellaneous
areas.”
4. Field and Publication Names and Symbols
The correlation of soil map units is formatted into four columns. List map unit symbols for
publication alphabetically or numerically in sequence. The heading and format are as follows:
Field Map Field Map Publication Map Approved Map
Unit Symbol Unit Name Unit Symbol Unit Name
DeB Delta sandy loam, AbB Alpha sandy

5. Series Established by This Correlation
List the soil series established by this correlation. List in parentheses, after the series name, the
county, the parish, or survey area and the State in which the type location occurs if the type location is in
a soil survey area other than the one being correlated. For example: “The Alpha series is established by
this correlation, the Alpha type location in the adjoining Beta County soil survey area, Any State.” Enter
“none” if no new series were established.
6. Series Dropped or Made Inactive by This Correlation
List the tentative soil series that were dropped or the established soil series that were made
inactive by the correlation. For example: “The Beta series is inactivated by this correlation.” Enter
“none” if no tentative series were dropped or no established soil series were made inactive.
7. Cooperators’ Names and Credits
List the following: The cooperators’ names and credits to be given in the published soil survey.
“United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service
In cooperation with
Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station

Any Soil and Water Conservation District”
“This survey was made for Any Survey Area, Anystate, by the Natural Resources Conservation
Service and the Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station, Anystate Conservation Commission, and the
Anystate Cooperative Extension Service. It is part of the technical assistance furnished to the Any
Survey Area Soil and Water Conservation District. The Any Survey Area Board of Commissioners
provided financial assistance for the survey.”
8. Prior Soil Survey Publications
Indicate the reference to prior soil survey publications that will appear in the introduction of the
published soil survey. A prior published soil survey is a literature citation in the soil survey publication.
For example: “The first soil survey for Any Survey Area, Anystate, was published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in 1903. Maps were printed in 1905. This soil survey is on an aerial
photography base and contains more interpretative information.” Enter “none” if there is no prior soil
survey publication.
9. Miscellaneous Items
Use the appropriate headings and include items pertinent to the correlation or publication of the
survey. For example, the soil-vegetation-climate schema, or model, used to guide correlation for the
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook

survey area should be included. Other examples include a summary of soil temperature or moisture
studies or special investigative reports that provided guidance for the survey area.
10. Instructions for Map Development
These brief instructions should include:
 Who is responsible for the development of digital spatial data
 The date and projection of the orthophoto imagery being used for the base map
 Who is responsible for digitizing the maps and when it is scheduled
 Who is responsible for finishing the digital maps and when it is scheduled
 Whether or not a layer for point and linear map units will be compiled and digitized
 Any other instructions that may be relevant to the achieving a digital soils layers
Detailed instructions for soil map data capture are found in part 647 of this handbook.
11. Feature and Symbol Legend
Include a copy of form NRCS-SOI-37A and indicate the features and symbols that are used in the
survey area by highlighting or underlining in red. For example: “Only those symbols indicated on the
NRCS-SOI-37A will be shown on the legend.” Complete the descriptions for standard landform and
miscellaneous surface features and descriptions for ad hoc features on the back of the form for those
features indicated.
12. General Soil Map Unit Legend
List the general soil map units that will be shown on the legend of the general soil map of the
survey area. For example:
“The following map units will be used on the general soil map legend:
Alpha-Beta to Alpha-Beta association
Beta-Gamma-Zeta to Beta-Gamma-Zeta association.”
13. Conversion Legend

2. Laboratory Data from the Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station Laboratory
Beta S79AS-047-005 BgB Beta
Gamma S79AS-047-006 AaA Alpha
3. Laboratory Data from the Anystate Highway Department Laboratory
Alpha S79AS-047-007 AaA Alpha
Beta S79AS-047-008 BbC Beta
16. Sampled Pedons in Published Soil Survey Report
This table lists the pedons and laboratory data that will be included in the published soil survey
report. These pedons should represent the typical pedon for the series in the survey area. If the pedon is
not the typical pedon for the series in the survey area, place a tabular or semi-tabular description in the
soil survey report.
Series Sample No. Status
Alpha S79AS-047-003 Typical pedon for the Alpha in
the survey area.
Alpha S79AS-047-011 Typical pedon from map unit Aa.
17. Notes to Accompany the Classification and Correlation of the Soils in the Survey Area
Notes of general explanation that contribute to the understanding of the correlation can be
included as an introductory paragraph. For example: “This survey area is in a transitional zone of soil
temperature regimes. Soils with mesic and thermic temperature regimes have been correlated.”
In the notes, include items such as:
(a) Pertinent information about series being established. For example: “Alpha Series. The
Alpha series is established by this correlation for soils that were formerly mapped as Beta but that have
mixed mineralogy rather than siliceous mineralogy as defined for Beta.”
(b) How taxadjuncts differ from the series concept. For example: “Gamma Taxadjunct. This
soil is a taxadjunct to the Gamma series because it contains less than 15 percent sand that is coarser than
very fine. The soil classifies as coarse-silty.”
(c) A correlation note for soils that are slightly outside the official series range, but are not
taxadjuncts. For example: “Beta soils in this survey have a redder subsoil and are slightly more acid
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-609-H, 1st Ed., Amend. 24, Oct. 2017)
609-B.5
throughout than those defined in the OSDs. These differences do not affect taxonomic placement or use
and management. The OSD was not revised because the color and reaction differences are due to the
inherent characteristics of the Theta geologic formation in which these soils formed and which is not the
typical formation in which the Beta series formed.”
18. Classification of the Soils
This table lists the classification of the taxonomic units that are used in the survey area. Classify
taxonomic units that are named at a level above the series as precisely as the data permits. Designate
taxadjuncts with an asterisk only if the representative pedon is a taxadjunct. Address map units with
major components that are taxadjuncts in the “notes.” Do not list miscellaneous area names in the
classification table. For example:
CLASSIFICATION OF THE SOILS OF ANY SURVEY AREA, ANYSTATE
Soil Name Family or Higher Taxonomic Class
Alpha Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Aridic Haploxerolls
Beta Fine-silty, mixed, active, frigid Cumulic Epiaquolls
Gamma* Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Dystric Eutrudepts
Udorthents Udorthents
*Taxadjunct. See “Notes to Accompany Classification and Correlation of the Soils of Any Survey Area,
Anystate” for details.
19. Join Statement
The join statement prepared at the final field review is included. It explains where an exact join
was not achieved and identifies what map units need review and their joins resolved.
20. Certifications
The correlation document is to contain certification of the following:
(a) Mapping is complete. For example: “Mapping completed in June 1999.”
(b) General soil maps and detailed maps join exactly with those of adjacent survey areas, and
detailed maps join within the survey area. Discrepancies in the join of maps with those of adjacent areas
are documented, and a detailed statement of join differences is referenced and included in the correlation
document. The reason the maps cannot be joined is given in the join statement.
(c) Databases and interpretations are coordinated and complete. For example: “Databases and
interpretations are coordinated, map unit lines of adjoining surveys are continuous across and along the
shared borders, and the joined map units share basic soil properties and selected soil qualities. All data
elements are populated and no obsolete terms are used.”
(d) Type locations are in soil areas that have the referenced names, and location descriptions are
correct. For example: “The locations of all typical pedons used in this survey are within the major land
resource area, are correct, and are within delineations that have the referenced name.”
(e) Forestland and rangeland site plots were taken in soil areas that have the referenced series
names, the series names have been correlated in the forestland and rangeland databases, and all data is
certified.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-609-H, 1st Ed., Amend. 24, Oct. 2017)
609-B.6
(f) All typical pedons are classified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd
edition and the latest edition
of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. For example: “All typical pedons are correctly classified according to
Soil Taxonomy, 2nd
edition and the latest edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.”
(g) Only approved names for miscellaneous areas have been used as component names, as
specified in Part 627, Exhibit 627-1, of this handbook.
(h) The soil maps have been reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. For
example: “The soil maps are complete, accurate, and consistent.”

649-B.24
CORRELATION and DESCRIPTIVE LEGEND
All map units correlated must have data to support the correlation—if not from the subset, then from
the MLRA. The MLRA concept must be used for developing the legend.
One legend is maintained for the survey containing the provisional and the approved map units for the
MLRA. The legend is the official, progressively correlated subset legend of the MLRA. The map
units in the legend have been approved by the SSR. The legend contains “provisional” map units that
are being mapped but have insufficient acreage or documentation. The type and amount of
documentation required for the map units to become approved depends on the complexity of the map
unit, existing documentation for the map unit within the MLRA, and previous correlation decisions.
Attach the legend. Include a list of map units added, dropped, or changed since the last review.
Summarize the documentation gathered and provide a narrative of the field stops seen on this review.
______ Is documentation sufficient for approved data map units on the legend?
______ Do all new series components of map units to be added to the legend classify properly in
accordance with the current edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy?
______ Are the properties (representative values) of all new components of map units as mapped in
the survey area within the range of the named series?
______ Are the OSDs up-to-date and contain current data for all series used in the survey area (e.g.,
typical pedon georeferenced, taxonomic classification, metric units of measure, horizon designations,
competing series section, diagnostic horizons and features listed)?
______ Have names for new series been reserved in the Soil Classification Database (SC Database)
accompanied by an OSD uploaded to the OSD file share?
______ Are the map unit names and design consistent with the MLRA soil survey area for this initial
soil survey?
______ Are all proposed changes in the legend recorded and reported in the appropriate NASIS
tables?
______ Are notes recorded in NASIS detailing the location and acreage of provisional map units until
they are approved for the ID legend?
______ Is a strategy in place for gathering documentation and are there instructions as to kind and
quality of field notes needed?
______ Does each project member have an up-to-date copy of the descriptive legend?
______ Is the descriptive legend adequate to ensure consistency of the mapping by all project
members and to ensure a timely completion of the publication?
______ Are the pedon descriptions stored in NASIS?
