Prime and Unique Farmlands--Important Farmlands Inventory
AGENCY: Natural Resources Conservation Service, Agriculture.
ACTION: Final rule.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: The Natural Resources Conservation Service is amending its
regulations regarding responsibilities for conducting important
farmland inventories under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and
Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act).
The amendments reflect changes to individual and organizational titles
made since the regulations were originally drafted.
EFFECTIVE DATE: September 25, 2000.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Horace Smith, Division Director, Soil
Survey Division, Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, D.C. 20013; 202-
720-1820.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule makes corrections to
nomenclature in the regulations for conducting important farmland
inventories (7 CFR
[[Page 57538]]
Part 657, Subpart A.) Since the implementing legislation was passed,
the names of the offices and titles of officials charged with
conducting important farmland inventories have changed. This amendment
reflects those changes. In addition, this rule amends the authority
citation to clarify the list of statutory authorities for the
inventories.
These rules are not expected to have significant economic impact
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. They will not
impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.
List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 657
Farmlands.

622-B.4
NRCS is concerned about any action that tends to impair the
productive capacity of American agriculture. The Nation needs to know
the extent and location of the best land for producing food, feed, fiber
forage, and oilseed crops. In addition to prime and unique farmlands,
farmlands that are of statewide and local importance for producing these
crops also need to be identified.
Sec. 657.2 Policy.
It is NRCS policy to make and keep current an inventory of the prime
farmland and unique farmland of the Nation. This inventory is to be
carried out in cooperation with other interested agencies at the
National, State, and local levels of government. The objective of the
inventory is to identify the extent and location of important rural
lands needed to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops.
Sec. 657.3 Applicability.
Inventories made under this memorandum do not constitute a
designation of any land area to a specific land use. Such designations
are the responsibility of appropriate local and State officials.
Sec. 657.4 NRCS responsibilities.
(a) State Conservationist. Each NRCS State Conservationist is to:
(1) Provide leadership for inventories of important farmlands for
the State, county, or other subdivision of the State. Each is to work
with appropriate agencies of State government and others to establish
priorities for making these inventories.
(2) Identify the soil mapping units within the State that qualify as
prime. In doing this, State Conservationists, in consultation with the
cooperators of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, have the
flexibility to make local deviation from the permeability criterion or
to be more restrictive for other specific criteria in order to assure
the most accurate identification of prime farmlands for a State. Each is
to invite representatives of the Governor's office, agencies of the
State government, and others to identify farmlands of statewide
importance and unique farmlands that are to be inventoried within the
framework of this memorandum.
(3) Prepare a statewide list of:
(i) Soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime farmland;
(ii) Soil mapping units that are farmlands of statewide importance
if the criteria used were based on soil information; and
(iii) Specific high-value food and fiber crops that are grown and,
when combined with other favorable factors, qualify lands to meet the
criteria for unique farmlands. Copies are to be furnished to NRCS Field
Offices and to National Soil Survey Center. (see 7 CFR 600.2(c), 600.6)
(4) Coordinate soil mapping units that qualify as prime
farmlands with adjacent States, including Major Land Resource Area
Offices (see 7 CFR 600.4, 600.7) responsible for the soil series.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-622-H, 1st Ed., Amend. 25, Nov. 2017)
622-B.5
Since farmlands of statewide importance and unique farmlands are
designated by others at the State level, the soil mapping units and
areas identified need not be coordinated among States.
(5) Instruct NRCS District Conservationists to arrange local review
of lands identified as prime, unique, and additional farmlands of
statewide importance by Conservation Districts and representatives of
local agencies. This review is to determine if additional farmland
should be identified to meet local decision making needs.
(6) Make and publish each important farmland inventory on a base map
of national map accuracy at an intermediate scale of 1:50,000 or
1:100,000. State Conservationists who need base maps of other scales are
to submit their requests with justification to the Chief for
consideration.
(b) National Soil Survey Center. The National Soil Survey Center is
to provide requested technical assistance to State Conservationists
and Major Land Resource Area Offices in inventorying prime and unique
farmlands (see 7 CFR 600.2(c)(1), 600.4, 600.7). This includes reviewing
statewide lists of soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime
farmlands and resolving coordination problems that may occur among
States for specific soil series or soil mapping units.
(c) National Office. The Deputy Chief for Soil Survey and Resource
Assessment (see 7 CFR 600.2(b)(3)) is to provide national leadership in
preparing guidelines for inventorying prime farmlands and for national
statistics and reports of prime farmlands.
Sec. 657.5 Identification of important farmlands.
(a) Prime farmlands--(1) General. Prime farmland is land that has
the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for
producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also
available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland,
rangeland, forest land, or other land, but not urban built-up land or
water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply
needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when
treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable
farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and
dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable
temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity,
acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are
permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible
or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do
not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils
that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent
slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0
to 5 percent slopes.
(2) Specific criteria. Prime farmlands meet all the following
criteria: Terms used in this section are defined in USDA publications:
``Soil Taxonomy, Agriculture Handbook 436''; ``Soil Survey Manual,
Agriculture Handbook 18''; ``Rainfall-erosion Losses From Cropland,
Agriculture Handbook 282''; ``Wind Erosion Forces in the United States
and Their Use in Predicting Soil Loss, Agriculture Handbook 346''; and
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-622-H, 1st Ed., Amend. 25, Nov. 2017)
622-B.6
``Saline and Alkali Soils, Agriculture Handbook 60.''
(i) The soils have:
(A) Aquic, udic, ustic, or xeric moisture regimes and sufficient
available water capacity within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter), or in
the root zone (root zone is the part of the soil that is penetrated or
can be penetrated by plant roots) if the root zone is less than 40
inches deep, to produce the commonly grown cultivated crops (cultivated
crops include, but are not limited to, grain, forage, fiber, oilseed,
sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush
fruit crops) adapted to the region in 7 or more years out of 10; or
(B) Xeric or ustic moisture regimes in which the available water
capacity is limited, but the area has a developed irrigation water
supply that is dependable (a dependable water supply is one in which
enough water is available for irrigation in 8 out of 10 years for the
crops commonly grown) and of adequate quality; or,
(C) Aridic or torric moisture regimes and the area has a developed
irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality; and,
(ii) The soils have a temperature regime that is frigid, mesic,
thermic, or hyperthermic (pergelic and cryic regimes are excluded).
These are soils that, at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm), have a mean
annual temperature higher than 32 deg. F (0 deg. C). In addition, the
mean summer temperature at this depth in soils with an O horizon is
higher than 47 deg. F (8 deg. C); in soils that have no O horizon, the
mean summer temperature is higher than 59 deg. F (15 deg. C); and,
(iii) The soils have a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in all horizons within
a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is
less than 40 inches deep; and,
(iv) The soils either have no water table or have a water table that
is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow
cultivated crops common to the area to be grown; and,
(v) The soils can be managed so that, in all horizons within a depth
of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is less than
40 inches deep, during part of each year the conductivity of the
saturation extract is less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium
percentage (ESP) is less than 15; and,
(vi) The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season
(less often than once in 2 years); and,
(vii) The product of K (erodibility factor) x percent slope is less
than 2.0, and the product of I (soils erodibility) x C (climatic
factor) does not exceed 60; and
(viii) The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch
(0.15 cm) per hour in the upper 20 inches (50 cm) and the mean annual
soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm) is less than 59 deg. F
(15 deg. C); the permeability rate is not a limiting factor if the mean
annual soil temperature is 59 deg. F (15 deg. C) or higher; and,
(ix) Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in
these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches (7.6 cm).
(b) Unique farmland--(1) General. Unique farmland is land other than
prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value
food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality,
location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-622-H, 1st Ed., Amend. 25, Nov. 2017)
622-B.7
produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop
when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods.
Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries,
fruit, and vegetables.
(2) Specific characteristics of unique farmland. (i) Is used for a
specific high-value food or fiber crop; (ii) Has a moisture supply that
is adequate for the specific crop; the supply is from stored moisture,
precipitation, or a developed-irrigation system; (iii) Combines
favorable factors of soil quality, growing season, temperature,
humidity, air drainage, elevation, aspect, or other conditions, such a
nearness to market, that favor the growth of a specific food or fiber
crop.
(c) Additional farmland of statewide importance. This is land, in
addition to prime and unique farmlands, that is of statewide importance
for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oil seed crops.
Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by
the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional
farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime
farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated
and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as
high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some
States, additonal farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts
of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law.
(d) Additional farmland of local importance. In some local areas
there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of
food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops, even though these lands are
not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where appropriate,
these lands are to be identified by the local agency or agencies concerned.
In places, additional farmlands of local importance may include tracts
of land that have been designated for agriculture by local ordinance.

1/ Claypans with permeability less than 0.06 in/hr will be treated as limiting the effective depth.
2/ Permeability of the least permeable subsurface horizon.
3/ Depth to water table during growing season.
4/ Available moisture between field capacity and wilting point.
5/ Use erosion hazard to help determine upper slope percent.
6/ In existing map units, 9% and 30% can be substituted for 8% and 25%.
7/ Column A is used for soils with K factors of 0.37 or greater and soils subject to rill and gully erosion, such as soils formed from granitic parent material or with claypans.
Other soils are rated in column B.
8/ For soluble salts and sodium to be a major limitation, there should be other soil limitations, such as slow permeability or a high water table.
9/ Examples are boron and magnesium that leach with difficulty.
10/ Rock fragments interfere with tillage but do not prevent cropping.
11/ Frequent flooding that does not prevent normal cropping.
12/ Rangeland and forestland. Mechanical practices can be applied to class 6 land.
13/ Rangeland and forestland. Mechanical practices can be applied to class 7 land.
14/ Class 8 lands have limitations that preclude their use for commercial plant production and restrict their use to recreation, water supply, or esthetic purposes.

Capability Unit Principal Soil Property or Limitation
1 Potential or actual wind or water erosion hazard
2
Drainage or overflow hazard (somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained, flooded, or
ponded)
3 Slowly or very slowly permeable subsoil or substrata
4 Coarse or gravelly textures
5 Fine textured (i.e., fine or very fine particle-size classes)
6 Salinity or sodicity, sufficient to constitute a continuing limitation or hazard
7 Stones, cobbles, or other rock fragments sufficient to interfere with tillage
8 Hardpan or hard unweathered bedrock within the root zone
9 Low inherent fertility, associated with strong acidity and low calcium
10 High organic matter and/or fiber content (i.e., peat, mucky peat, and muck)
11 Coarse sandy or very gravelly substrata that limit root penetration and moisture retention
