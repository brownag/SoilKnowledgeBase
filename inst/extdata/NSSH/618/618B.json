Soc. Am. J. 51:1250-1256. 4/ Total acidity is roughly equal to extractable acidity. Extractable acidity is determined by method 4B2a1a1, as outlined in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 4.0, November 2004. 5/ Electrical conductivity is measured using method 4F2, as outlined in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 4.0, November 2004. The relationship between resistivity of a saturated soil paste and electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is influenced by variations in the saturation percentage, salinity, and conductivity of the soil minerals. These two measurements generally correspond closely enough to place a soil in one risk of corrosion potential class. 6/ Soils that remain saturated for extended periods are excluded from the high risk of corrosion potential class unless EC values are more than 10 dS m-1 (Moore and Hallmark, 1987). In the NASIS steel corrosion calculation, saturation for extended periods is defined as having very shallow internal free water occurrence for 12 months. 7/ Resistivity at saturation is roughly equivalent to resistivity of fine and medium textured soils measured at saturation (Method 4F2b2 as outlined in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 4.0, November 2004). Resistivity at saturation for coarse textured soils is generally lower than that obtained at field capacity and may cause the soil to be placed in a higher risk of corrosion potential class.",

Since total rock fragments are 28 percent, choose the first row (≥ 15 and < 35). 2. Under “Gravel (GR), cobbles, . . .”, test the criterion in the left-most column. Is 15%GR ≥ 1.5 (10% CB) + 2 (3% ST)? Answer: NO. 3. Proceed to the next column. Is 10%CB ≥ 1.5 (3% ST)? Answer: YES. STOP. The modifier is Cobbly. 1 If both flat and nonflat rock fragments are present, the quantity in each size class is summed (e.g., gravel + channers, cobbles + flagstones). The sums are used to determine the appropriate quantity/size modifier. If the amounts of flat and nonflat rock fragments within any given size class are equal, the nonflat modifier takes precedence. For example, if there are 10 percent gravel and 10 percent channers, the modifier is gravelly. Soils With Pararock Fragments Only.—The same basic weighting rules apply with pararock fragments as with flat and nonflat rock fragments. However, the above spreadsheet only outputs modifier terms for rock fragments. To assign the correct pararock fragment modifier to the outputted rock modifier term, simply precede the modifier with “para.” For example, if the calculator outputs “very cobbly,” the correct modifier is “very paracobbly.” Soils With Both Rock and Pararock Fragments.—Refer to instructions in section 618.67H(2)(vii) of this handbook.",

      "content": "618.93 General Guidelines for Assigning Soil Loss Tolerance “T” Soil loss tolerance “T” is assigned according to properties of root and plant growth limiting subsurface soil layers. The designation of a limiting layer implies that the material above the layer has more favorable plant growth properties. As limiting or less favorable soil layers become closer to the soil surface, the relative ability of a soil to maintain its productivity through natural and managed processes decreases. Caution should be used in comparing T factors across soils for soil quality or productivity. For examples, soils with a T factor of 5 may not be the most productive and soils with the same T factor rating may not be equally productive. For example, a soil that has a T factor of 5 and is sandy throughout is not as naturally fertile nor can it hold as much available water as a soil that has a T factor of 5 that is loamy throughout. The criteria for assigning T factor are estimated from both of the following: 1. The severity of physical or chemical properties of subsurface layers 2. The economic feasibility of utilizing management practices to overcome limiting layers or conditions The following general guide was used with specific soil properties and conditions to write criteria statements for programming T factors as a calculation in NASIS.

If percent rock and pararock fragments by volume is 35-60, reduce “I” value by two favorable groups except for sands and loamy sand textures which are reduced by one group with more favorable rating. If percent rock and pararock fragments is greater than 60, use “I” value of 0 for all textures except sands and loamy sand textures which are reduced by three groups with more favorable ratings. An example of more favorable “I” rating is next lower number: “I” factor of 160 to “I” factor of 134 or “I” factor of 86 to “I” factor of 56. The index values should correspond exactly to their wind erodibility group (e.g., “I” factor of 56 = WEG 5). 2 The “I” values for WEG 1 vary from 160 for coarse sands to 310 for very fine sands. Use an “I” of 220 as an average figure. 3 All material that meets criterion 3 in the required characteristics for andic soil properties as defined in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition. Such material is placed in WEG 2 regardless of the texture class of the fine-earth fraction. 4 All material that meets criterion 2, but not criterion 3, in the required characteristics for andic soil properties as defined in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition. Such material is placed in WEG 6, regardless of the texture class of the fine-earth fraction. The only exception to this is for Cryic Spodosols which have a medial substitute class and a MAAT < 4 degrees C.; these soils are placed in WEG 2. 5 For surface layers or horizons that do not meet the required characteristics for andic soil properties but do meet Vitrandic, Vitritorrandic, Vitrixerandic, and Ustivitrandic subgroup criteria (thickness criterion excluded) move one wind erodibility group (WEG) with a less favorable rating. 6 Calcareous is a strongly or violently effervescent reaction (class) of the fine-earth fraction to cold dilute (1N) HCL; a paper “Computing the Wind Erodible Fraction of Soils” by D. W. Fryear et.al (1994) in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 49 (2) 183-188 raises a yet unresolved question regarding the effect of carbonates on wind erosion. 7 For mineral soils with thin “O” horizons, the WEG is based on the first mineral horizon.

Caution: Estimates of CEC or ECEC for soil layers with andic soil properties may be unreliable. Read the documentation to this calculation to see if it will work for your soils. Inputs.—This calculation requires the following data to be populated: organic matter (high, low, and rv) pH in water (high, low, and rv) pH in CaCl (for organic layers) (high, low, and rv) total clay (high, low, and rv) carbonate clay (high, low, and rv) total silt (high, low, and rv) CaCO3 (high, low, and rv) used only for soils containing gypsum gypsum (high, low, and rv) used only for soils containing gypsum taxonomic family mineralogy taxonomic order taxonomic CEC-activity class 1) The calculation is based on Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). The CEC or ECEC is calculated based on the family mineralogy/CEC-activity class first. If an equation does not exist for a mineralogy/CEC-activity class, then the CEC/ECEC is based on the soil order. 2) If the family mineralogy class, CEC-activity class (if appropriate), and soil order are not populated, a null is returned. 3) If there is more than one family mineralogy class populated in the “Component-Taxonomic- Family-Mineralogy Table,” the first one is used. 4) If the pH in water is not populated, then pH in CaCl is used. If the pH (CaCl) is greater than or equal to 5.1, then CEC is calculated; otherwise ECEC is calculated for a horizon. 5) If any required data element (OM, pH, clay, silt) for an equation is not populated (null entry), a null is returned, except for carbonate clay. 6) If carbonate clay is null, zero carbonate clay is assumed. 7) Noncarbonate clay is calculated by subtracting percent carbonate clay from totalclay (noncarbonated clay = total_clay - carbonate_clay). 8) Percent organic matter is converted to percent organic C by dividing by 1.72 (OC = OM/1.72). 9) If only low and high values are populated for a data element, an rv is calculated by taking the average of the low and high values. 10) In the calculation of CEC for isotic and amorphic mineralogies and Andisols and for isotic mineralogy for ECEC, gravimetric 15-bar water is used. An internal calculation calculates the 15-bar water using the following formula: 15-bar water = [total_clay (1 - organic_matter / 100) 0.4 + organic_matter] 11) In the calculation of ECEC, if the mineralogy class is not parasesquic, smectitic, or isotic and is not mixed or siliceous with a CEC activity class and the soil order is Andisols, Gelisols, Aridisols, or Vertisols, then no ECEC is calculated (null is returned).

The low, rv, and high are calculated. The calculation works on all records (horizons) in your selected set that you have permission to edit, except as described in (7) below. For some horizons, such as bedrock or cemented layers, it may not be appropriate to calculate Atterberg limits. You may wish to tailor your selected set accordingly. There is a companion report available to preview results of this calculation. The calculation script is imbedded in the report script. The report is designed to display your current stored LL and PI values alongside the calculated values. Viewing the results in this fashion might be useful in determining whether or not you wish to run the calculation on your selected set. The name of the Pangaea report is “UTIL - Comparison of LL and PI, stored vs calculated.” Caution: These calculations for liquid limit and plasticity index may produce poor estimates for Andisols and Spodosols. Inputs.—This calculation requires that the following data must be populated: organic matter percent (l,rv,h) linear extensibility percent (l,rv,h) clay total separate (l,rv,h) clay sized carbonate (l,rv,h) Guidelines For Implementing Equations for LL and PI In NASIS 1) Values for LL and PI (low, high, and rv) are computed. 2) The calculations are based on the noncarbonate clay fraction. 3) If clay sized carbonate is null, then noncarbonate clay = total clay. 4) The water 15bar (volumetric) values from the database are not used. Instead water 15-bar value is estimated on a gravimetric basis using total clay and organic matter values. 5) If low and/or high values for LEP, clay sized carbonate, or OM are null, set to zero and proceed with estimate (reduced accuracy is < 1.5%). 6) If rv values for these input variables are null, compute as the average of low and high values (L + H/2) and proceed with the calculation. 7) If OM > 25% or total clay is null, then LL and PI are not calculated. 8) The PI is estimated first, then LL. 9) If PI equals 0, LL rv and low values are set to 0 and the LL high value is set to 14. 10) If LL is < 15, then LL rv and low values are set to 0 and LL high value is set to 14. 11) Computed values for LL and PI are converted to nearest whole number.

      "content": "618.104 NASIS Calculation for Estimating Rock Fragments and Percent Passing Sieves Definition.—This calculation computes the percent soil material (< 3 inch basis) passing the #4 (4.7 mm), #10 (2.0 mm), #40 (0.42 mm), and #200 sieves (0.074 mm) and the percent rock fragments 3 to 10 inches and > 10 inches (whole soil basis). 1. Percent passing sieves are on a < 3-inch basis and rock fragments are a whole-soil basis. 2. The calculation of percent passing sieves and rock fragments excludes pararock fragments, wood, and noncemented fragments. Pararock fragments are defined by fragment hardness of extremely weakly, very weakly, weakly, or moderately cemented. 3. If fragment hardness is not populated, “indurated” is assumed. 4. If fragment kind is not populated, a fragment density of 2.65 g cm-3 is assumed. 5. Fragment density is assigned based on the fragment kind (table 2). If an average density for each fragment kind is not available, a default density of 2.65 g cm-3 is used. 6. If only low and high values are populated for fragment volume, fragment size, total sand, total silt, total clay, or sand separates, then rv’s are generated from the high and low values (takes the average). 7. The low and high values must be populated for fragment size, otherwise the calculation will produce incorrect or no results. 8. Low and high values for percent passing #40 and #200 sieves are based on the average low and high values for the particle-size separates. 9. If low and high values are not populated for total sand, total silt, or total clay or for the sand separates, then low and high values for the #40 and #200 sieves are generated from the low and high values of total clay. If high and low values for total clay are also null, then nulls are returned. 10. Low and high values for percent passing #4 and #10 sieves and the rock fragments are based on the low and high fragment volumes (in “Horizon Table,” if populated). If low and high fragment volumes (in “Horizon Table”) are not populated, then total low and high fragment volumes in the “Horizon Fragment Table” are used. If low and high fragment volumes in the “Horizon Fragment Table” are null, then nulls are returned. 11. Caution: If percent passing sieves are populated and only clay is populated (l, rv, h) in the particle-size separates, the calculation will wipe out the calculated values and put in null values. If there is not enough data to run the calculation, nulls are returned. 12. For stratified textures, if data is populated, the calculation proceeds as normal. If the particle-size separates are not populated, then the #40 and #200 sieves are not calculated (nulls are returned). 13. If the organic matter content > 35%, then percent passing sieves is not calculated and only rock fragments (3 to 10 in and >10 in) are calculated. 14. Caution: If 1/3-bar bulk density rv is not populated, null values for all sieves and rock fragments are returned. 15. The calculation rounds all sieve values to the nearest whole number. Limitations 1) The pararock fragments are not included in the calculation because they can be crushed to < 2 mm. It is assumed that the pararock fragments, when crushed, will reflect the existing particle- size distribution. If there are pararock fragments that when crushed produce a different particle- size distribution, the calculation will over- or under-estimate the percent passing the #40 and #200 sieves. 2) When actually measuring percent passing sieves, the organic matter is not removed. The calculation of percent passing sieves calculates using organic matter free particle-size fractions. The calculation does not take into account the distribution of organic matter particles. Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook 3) The fragment densities applied here are average values from the literature and may not represent the true density of fragments in your area. Fragment densities can be highly variable from location to location for a fragment kind. 4) If the total fragment volumes in the “Component Horizon Table” are not populated, then the low and high calculated values are based on the “Horizon Fragment Table” volumes and texture ranges in the NASIS database; these values may not reflect the actual percent passing sieves and rock fragment ranges. It is assumed that the total of the lows and the total of the highs in the “Horizon Fragment Table” equal the total high and low fragment volumes. 5) If the low and high calculated values are based on the total fragment volumes in the “Component Horizon Table” because actual fragment kind distributions (e.g., rock vs. pararock) that make up the fragment volume totals are not known, percent passing sieves and rock fragment may not reflect actual ranges. It computes representative values for the sand fractions, total sand and total silt. The following rules apply: a. The results will be blank if needed data are not entered. Total clay and texture are always required, and particle size class is required for textures CL, L, SCL, SICL, andSIL. b. When a horizon has multiple textures the one marked rv is used; the first texture is used if there is no rv. No results are calculated for stratified textures at this time. c. If total sand (rv) has been entered, the sand fractions will be adjusted so their sum equals the specified total. If you want to calculate a new sand total you must erase the old one before running the calculation. Inputs.—This calculation requires the following data to be populated: fragment volume total (high, low) in “Horizon Table” fragment volume (high, low, and rv) in “Horizon Fragment Table” fragment kind in “Horizon Fragment Table” fragment size (high, low, and rv) in “Horizon Fragment Table” fragment hardness in “Horizon Fragment Table” total sand (high, low, and rv) total clay (high, low, and rv) total silt (high, low, and rv) very fine sand (high, low, and rv) fine sand (high, low, and rv) medium sand (high, low, and rv) coarse sand (high, low, and rv) very coarse sand (high, low, and rv) one-third bar bulk density (rv) organic matter (rv) Calculation DEFINE curvenum_l 0.56559. #run curve fitting routine DEFINE curvenum_h 0.56559. #run curve fitting routine DEFINE curvenum_r 0.56559. #run curve fitting routine DEFINE densityrock IF fragkind2 == \"`a`a lava\" THEN 2.00 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"amphibolite\" THEN 2.99 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"andesite\" THEN 2.65 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"anorthosite\" THEN 2.73 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"basalt\" THEN 2.69 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"calcrete (caliche)\" THEN 1.44 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"chalk\" THEN 2.35 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"charcoal\" THEN 0.45 Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"chert\" THEN 2.76 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"cinders\" THEN 1.45 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"coal\" THEN 1.6 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"dacite\" THEN 1.67 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"diabase\" THEN 2.92 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"diorite\" THEN 2.83 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"dolomite (dolostone)\" THEN 2.79 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"gabbro\" THEN 2.99 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"gibbsite concretions\" THEN 2.35 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"gneiss\" THEN 2.79 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"granite\" THEN 2.66 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"granodiorite\" THEN 2.72 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"granulite\" THEN 2.91 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"graywacke\" THEN 2.69 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"gypsum, rock\" THEN 2.55 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"ironstone concretions\" THEN 2.93 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"limestone, unspecified\" THEN 2.61 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"marble\" THEN 2.74 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"monzonite\" THEN 2.8 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"obsidian\" THEN 2.37 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"orthoquartzite\" THEN 2.41 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"peridotite\" THEN 3.22 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"petroferric fragments\" THEN 2.93 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"phyllite\" THEN 2.74 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"pumice\" THEN 0.98 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"pyroxenite\" THEN 3.28 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"quartz-diorite\" THEN 2.79 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"quartzite\" THEN 2.7 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"rhyolite\" THEN 2.51 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"sandstone, calcareous\" THEN 2.03 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"sandstone, unspecified\" THEN 2.29 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"schist, mica\" THEN 2.76 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"schist, unspecified\" THEN 2.84 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"serpentinite\" THEN 2.63 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"shale, calcareous\" THEN 2.67 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"shale, clayey\" THEN 2.78 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"shale, unspecified\" THEN 2.6 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"slate\" THEN 2.81 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"soapstone\" THEN 2.7 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"syenite\" THEN 2.74 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"tonalite\" THEN 2.67 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"trachyte\" THEN 2.57 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"tuff, unspecified\" THEN 1.84 ELSE IF fragkind2 == \"wood\" THEN 0.6 ELSE 2.65.",
